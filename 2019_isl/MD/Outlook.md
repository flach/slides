## Outlook

Proper treatment of performance evaluation in machine learning (and AI more generally) requires a sophisticated model with the following components: 
- *Measurement theory* for the observable performance indicators; 
- *Latent-variable models* for the unobservable performance indicators of interest; 
  - e.g., inspired by item-response theory, see our forthcoming AISTATS paper
- *Causal models* to allow for counterfactual reasoning.
